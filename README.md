Description:
Here, we have developed a CPU Scheduling algorithm based on Deadline time.
Deadline time is a predetermined time restriction by which a process must be finished its execution.
The Deadline Scheduling method is a CPU scheduling approach used in real-time systems to ensure that jobs with defined deadlines are completed on time. Its goal is to prioritize activities based on their deadlines and to optimize system performance by minimizing missed deadlines.
Each process under Deadline Scheduling is assigned a deadline, indicating the maximum permissible time for its execution. Processes are prioritized by the algorithm based on their deadlines, with shorter deadlines gaining higher importance. This guarantees that processes with shorter deadlines are completed first, reducing the possibility of missing key deadlines.
The completed process is withdrawn from the queue after execution, and the scheduler selects the next process with the earliest deadline for execution.
